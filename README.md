# FFX2SaveEditor
A save editor for FFX2 on PS3/PC

This editor will allow you to view and change the pesky story completion flags, among other things. So far, no one has asked this to be updated for the PS2 so I have not even coded it :)

## How to Use
* Make sure you select the right file type when opening your save, or it might filter out your save and you can't find it!
* Use your scroll wheel inside quantity inputs (like item count) to quickly add or remove quantity.
