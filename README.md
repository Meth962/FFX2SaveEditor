# FFX2SaveEditor
A save editor for FFX2 on PS3/PC

This editor will allow you to view and change the pesky story completion flags, among other things. So far, no one has asked this to be updated for the PS2 so I have not even coded it :)

## How to Use
* For PC, just open any of the "ffx2_###" files.
* For PS3, you need to select multiple files. You need all three of these:
   * PARAM.PFD
   * PARAM.SFO
   * SAVES
* When changing your Gil, hit the Enter key to finish editing the amount.
* Any menu you go into, use the same button to get back.
* Use your scroll wheel inside quantity inputs (like item count) to quickly add or remove quantity.
* [PS3] Back up your save files! When you attempt to save your PS3 file, you will get a last warning to back them up.
* [PS3] Use the ConvertToPC button to create a PC compatible save.
   * Just name it any ffx2_### (but don't overwrite your own saves :) just pick a different number)
   
 ## TODO / Ideas
 * Add controller support
 * Auto backup PS3 files or give option to save elsewhere.
